## General Information
- A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state. 
- BoomBikes aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19
- BoomBikes wishes to understand which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes and how well those variables describe the bike demands
- the dataset being used is one which has multiple data related to bikes demand and considers various factors such as weather, humidity, day of the week , holiday, temperature, month etc. which can help us to predict what all factors are actually affecting bike demand
